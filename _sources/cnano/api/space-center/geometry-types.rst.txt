Geometry Types
==============

Vectors
-------

3-dimensional vectors are represented as a 3-tuple. For example:

.. literalinclude:: /scripts/services/space-center/Vector3.c

Quaternions
-----------

Quaternions (rotations in 3-dimensional space) are encoded as a 4-tuple
containing the x, y, z and w components. For example:

.. literalinclude:: /scripts/services/space-center/Quaternion.c
