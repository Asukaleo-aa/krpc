AutoPilot
=========


.. class:: AutoPilot

   Provides basic auto-piloting utilities for a vessel.
   Created by calling :attr:`SpaceCenter.Vessel.auto_pilot`.

   .. note::

      If a client engages the auto-pilot and then closes its connection to the server,
      the auto-pilot will be disengaged and its target reference frame, direction and roll
      reset to default.

   .. method:: engage()

      Engage the auto-pilot.

   .. method:: disengage()

      Disengage the auto-pilot.

   .. method:: wait()

      Blocks until the vessel is pointing in the target direction and has
      the target roll (if set). Throws an exception if the auto-pilot has not been engaged.

   .. attribute:: error

      The error, in degrees, between the direction the ship has been asked
      to point in and the direction it is pointing in. Throws an exception if the auto-pilot
      has not been engaged and SAS is not enabled or is in stability assist mode.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: pitch_error

      The error, in degrees, between the vessels current and target pitch.
      Throws an exception if the auto-pilot has not been engaged.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: heading_error

      The error, in degrees, between the vessels current and target heading.
      Throws an exception if the auto-pilot has not been engaged.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: roll_error

      The error, in degrees, between the vessels current and target roll.
      Throws an exception if the auto-pilot has not been engaged or no target roll is set.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: reference_frame

      The reference frame for the target direction (:attr:`SpaceCenter.AutoPilot.target_direction`).

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: :class:`SpaceCenter.ReferenceFrame`

      .. note::

         An error will be thrown if this property is set to a reference frame that rotates with
         the vessel being controlled, as it is impossible to rotate the vessel in such a
         reference frame.

   .. attribute:: target_pitch

      The target pitch, in degrees, between -90° and +90°.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: target_heading

      The target heading, in degrees, between 0° and 360°.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: target_roll

      The target roll, in degrees. ``NaN`` if no target roll is set.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: target_direction

      Direction vector corresponding to the target pitch and heading.
      This is in the reference frame specified by :class:`SpaceCenter.ReferenceFrame`.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: Tuple of (number, number, number)

   .. method:: target_pitch_and_heading(pitch, heading)

      Set target pitch and heading angles.

      :param number pitch: Target pitch angle, in degrees between -90° and +90°.
      :param number heading: Target heading angle, in degrees between 0° and 360°.

   .. attribute:: sas

      The state of SAS.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: boolean

      .. note::

         Equivalent to :attr:`SpaceCenter.Control.sas`

   .. attribute:: sas_mode

      The current :class:`SpaceCenter.SASMode`.
      These modes are equivalent to the mode buttons to the left of the navball that appear
      when SAS is enabled.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: :class:`SpaceCenter.SASMode`

      .. note::

         Equivalent to :attr:`SpaceCenter.Control.sas_mode`

   .. attribute:: roll_threshold

      The threshold at which the autopilot will try to match the target roll angle, if any.
      Defaults to 5 degrees.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: stopping_time

      The maximum amount of time that the vessel should need to come to a complete stop.
      This determines the maximum angular velocity of the vessel.
      A vector of three stopping times, in seconds, one for each of the pitch, roll
      and yaw axes. Defaults to 0.5 seconds for each axis.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: Tuple of (number, number, number)

   .. attribute:: deceleration_time

      This determines the angular acceleration used to decelerate the vessel.
      A vector of three times, in seconds, one for each of the pitch, roll and yaw axes.
      Defaults to 5 seconds for each axis.

   .. attribute:: attenuation_angle

      The angle at which the autopilot considers the vessel to be pointing
      close to the target.
      This determines the midpoint of the target velocity attenuation function.
