Resources
=========


.. class:: Resources

   Represents the collection of resources stored in a vessel, stage or part.
   Created by calling :attr:`SpaceCenter.Vessel.resources`,
   :meth:`SpaceCenter.Vessel.resources_in_decouple_stage` or
   :attr:`SpaceCenter.Part.resources`.

   .. attribute:: all

      All the individual resources that can be stored.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: List of :class:`SpaceCenter.Resource`

   .. method:: with_resource(name)

      All the individual resources with the given name that can be stored.

      :param string name:
      :rtype: List of :class:`SpaceCenter.Resource`

   .. attribute:: names

      A list of resource names that can be stored.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: List of string

   .. method:: has_resource(name)

      Check whether the named resource can be stored.

      :param string name: The name of the resource.
      :rtype: boolean

   .. method:: amount(name)

      Returns the amount of a resource that is currently stored.

      :param string name: The name of the resource.
      :rtype: number

   .. method:: max(name)

      Returns the amount of a resource that can be stored.

      :param string name: The name of the resource.
      :rtype: number

   .. staticmethod:: density(name)

      Returns the density of a resource, in kg/l.

      :param string name: The name of the resource.
      :rtype: number

   .. staticmethod:: flow_mode(name)

      Returns the flow mode of a resource.

      :param string name: The name of the resource.
      :rtype: :class:`SpaceCenter.ResourceFlowMode`

   .. attribute:: enabled

      Whether use of all the resources are enabled.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: boolean

      .. note::

         This is true if all of the resources are enabled. If any of the resources are not enabled, this is false.



.. class:: Resource

   An individual resource stored within a part.
   Created using methods in the :class:`SpaceCenter.Resources` class.

   .. attribute:: name

      The name of the resource.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: string

   .. attribute:: part

      The part containing the resource.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: :class:`SpaceCenter.Part`

   .. attribute:: amount

      The amount of the resource that is currently stored in the part.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: max

      The total amount of the resource that can be stored in the part.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: density

      The density of the resource, in :math:`kg/l`.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: flow_mode

      The flow mode of the resource.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: :class:`SpaceCenter.ResourceFlowMode`

   .. attribute:: enabled

      Whether use of this resource is enabled.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: boolean



.. class:: ResourceTransfer

   Transfer resources between parts.

   .. staticmethod:: start(from_part, to_part, resource, max_amount)

      Start transferring a resource transfer between a pair of parts. The transfer will move at most
      *max_amount* units of the resource, depending on how much of the resource is
      available in the source part and how much storage is available in the destination part.
      Use :attr:`SpaceCenter.ResourceTransfer.complete` to check if the transfer is complete.
      Use :attr:`SpaceCenter.ResourceTransfer.amount` to see how much of the resource has been transferred.

      :param SpaceCenter.Part from_part: The part to transfer to.
      :param SpaceCenter.Part to_part: The part to transfer from.
      :param string resource: The name of the resource to transfer.
      :param number max_amount: The maximum amount of resource to transfer.
      :rtype: :class:`SpaceCenter.ResourceTransfer`

   .. attribute:: amount

      The amount of the resource that has been transferred.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: complete

      Whether the transfer has completed.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: boolean



.. class:: ResourceFlowMode

   The way in which a resource flows between parts. See :meth:`SpaceCenter.Resources.flow_mode`.


   .. data:: vessel

      The resource flows to any part in the vessel. For example, electric charge.


   .. data:: stage

      The resource flows from parts in the first stage, followed by the second,
      and so on. For example, mono-propellant.


   .. data:: adjacent

      The resource flows between adjacent parts within the vessel. For example,
      liquid fuel or oxidizer.


   .. data:: none

      The resource does not flow. For example, solid fuel.
