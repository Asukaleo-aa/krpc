Waypoints
=========


.. class:: WaypointManager

   Waypoints are the location markers you can see on the map view showing you where contracts are targeted for.
   With this structure, you can obtain coordinate data for the locations of these waypoints.
   Obtained by calling :attr:`SpaceCenter.waypoint_manager`.

   .. attribute:: waypoints

      A list of all existing waypoints.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: List of :class:`SpaceCenter.Waypoint`

   .. method:: add_waypoint(latitude, longitude, body, name)

      Creates a waypoint at the given position at ground level, and returns a
      :class:`SpaceCenter.Waypoint` object that can be used to modify it.

      :param number latitude: Latitude of the waypoint.
      :param number longitude: Longitude of the waypoint.
      :param SpaceCenter.CelestialBody body: Celestial body the waypoint is attached to.
      :param string name: Name of the waypoint.
      :rtype: :class:`SpaceCenter.Waypoint`

   .. method:: add_waypoint_at_altitude(latitude, longitude, altitude, body, name)

      Creates a waypoint at the given position and altitude, and returns a
      :class:`SpaceCenter.Waypoint` object that can be used to modify it.

      :param number latitude: Latitude of the waypoint.
      :param number longitude: Longitude of the waypoint.
      :param number altitude: Altitude (above sea level) of the waypoint.
      :param SpaceCenter.CelestialBody body: Celestial body the waypoint is attached to.
      :param string name: Name of the waypoint.
      :rtype: :class:`SpaceCenter.Waypoint`

   .. attribute:: colors

      An example map of known color - seed pairs.
      Any other integers may be used as seed.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: Map from string to number

   .. attribute:: icons

      Returns all available icons (from "GameData/Squad/Contracts/Icons/").

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: List of string



.. class:: Waypoint

   Represents a waypoint. Can be created using :meth:`SpaceCenter.WaypointManager.add_waypoint`.

   .. attribute:: body

      The celestial body the waypoint is attached to.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: :class:`SpaceCenter.CelestialBody`

   .. attribute:: name

      The name of the waypoint as it appears on the map and the contract.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: string

   .. attribute:: color

      The seed of the icon color. See :attr:`SpaceCenter.WaypointManager.colors` for example colors.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: icon

      The icon of the waypoint.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: string

   .. attribute:: latitude

      The latitude of the waypoint.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: longitude

      The longitude of the waypoint.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: mean_altitude

      The altitude of the waypoint above sea level, in meters.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: surface_altitude

      The altitude of the waypoint above the surface of the body or sea level,
      whichever is closer, in meters.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: bedrock_altitude

      The altitude of the waypoint above the surface of the body, in meters.
      When over water, this is the altitude above the sea floor.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: near_surface

      ``True`` if the waypoint is near to the surface of a body.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: boolean

   .. attribute:: grounded

      ``True`` if the waypoint is attached to the ground.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: boolean

   .. attribute:: index

      The integer index of this waypoint within its cluster of sibling waypoints.
      In other words, when you have a cluster of waypoints called "Somewhere Alpha",
      "Somewhere Beta" and "Somewhere Gamma", the alpha site has index 0, the beta
      site has index 1 and the gamma site has index 2.
      When :attr:`SpaceCenter.Waypoint.clustered` is ``False``, this is zero.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: number

   .. attribute:: clustered

      ``True`` if this waypoint is part of a set of clustered waypoints with greek letter
      names appended (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc).
      If ``True``, there is a one-to-one correspondence with the greek letter name and
      the :attr:`SpaceCenter.Waypoint.index`.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: boolean

   .. attribute:: has_contract

      Whether the waypoint belongs to a contract.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: boolean

   .. attribute:: contract

      The associated contract.

      :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
      :rtype: :class:`SpaceCenter.Contract`

   .. method:: remove()

      Removes the waypoint.
