   active.

   :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
   :rtype: float




.. attribute:: warp_factor

   The current warp factor. This is the index of the rate at which time
   is passing for either regular "on-rails" or physical time warp. Returns 0
   if time warp is not active. When in on-rails time warp, this is equal to
   :attr:`rails_warp_factor`, and in physics time warp, this is equal to
   :attr:`physics_warp_factor`.

   :Attribute: Read-only, cannot be set
   :rtype: float




.. attribute:: rails_warp_factor

   The time warp rate, using regular "on-rails" time warp. A value between
   0 and 7 inclusive. 0 means no time warp. Returns 0 if physical time warp
   is active.

   If requested time warp factor cannot be set, it will be set to the next
   lowest possible value. For example, if the vessel is too close to a
   planet. See `the KSP wiki <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Time_warp>`_ for details.

   :Attribute: Can be read or written
   :rtype: int




.. attribute:: physics_warp_factor

   The physical time warp rate. A value between 0 and 3 inclusive. 0 means
   no time warp. Returns 0 if regular "on-rails" time warp is active.

   :rtype: int




.. staticmethod:: can_rails_warp_at([factor = 1])

   Returns ``True`` if regular "on-rails" time warp can be used, at the specified warp
   *factor*. The maximum time warp rate is limited by various things,
   including how close the active vessel is to a planet. See
   `the KSP wiki <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Time_warp>`_ for details.

   :param int factor: The warp factor to check.

.. staticmethod:: warp_to(ut, [max_rails_rate = 100000.0], [max_physics_rate = 2.0])

   Uses time acceleration to warp forward to a time in the future, specified
   by universal time *ut*. This call blocks until the desired
   time is reached. Uses regular "on-rails" or physical time warp as appropriate.
   For example, physical time warp is used when the active vessel is traveling
   through an atmosphere. When using regular "on-rails" time warp, the warp
   rate is limited by *max_rails_rate*, and when using physical
   time warp, the warp rate is limited by *max_physics_rate*.
