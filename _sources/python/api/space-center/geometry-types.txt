.. class:: Vector3

   3-dimensional vectors are represented as a 3-tuple. For example:

   .. literalinclude:: /scripts/Vector3.py

.. class:: Quaternion

   Quaternions (rotations in 3-dimensional space) are encoded as a 4-tuple
   containing the x, y, z and w components. For example:

   .. literalinclude:: /scripts/Quaternion.py
