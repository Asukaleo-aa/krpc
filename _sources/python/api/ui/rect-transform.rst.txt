   A Unity engine Rect Transform for a UI object.
   See the `Unity manual <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-RectTransform.html>`_ for more details.

   .. attribute:: position

      Position of the rectangles pivot point relative to the anchors.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: tuple(float, float)

   .. attribute:: local_position

      Position of the rectangles pivot point relative to the anchors.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: tuple(float, float, float)

   .. attribute:: size

      Width and height of the rectangle.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: tuple(float, float)

   .. attribute:: upper_right

      Position of the rectangles upper right corner relative to the anchors.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: tuple(float, float)

   .. attribute:: lower_left

      Position of the rectangles lower left corner relative to the anchors.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: tuple(float, float)

   .. attribute:: anchor

      Set the minimum and maximum anchor points as a fraction of the size of the parent rectangle.

      :Attribute: Write-only, cannot be read
      :rtype: tuple(float, float)

   .. attribute:: anchor_max

      The anchor point for the lower left corner of the rectangle defined as a fraction of the size of the parent rectangle.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: tuple(float, float)

   .. attribute:: anchor_min

      The anchor point for the upper right corner of the rectangle defined as a fraction of the size of the parent rectangle.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: tuple(float, float)

   .. attribute:: pivot

      Location of the pivot point around which the rectangle rotates, defined as a fraction of the size of the rectangle itself.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: tuple(float, float)

   .. attribute:: rotation

      Rotation, as a quaternion, of the object around its pivot point.

      :Attribute: Can be read or written
      :rtype: tuple(float, float, float, float)

   .. attribute:: scale

      Scale factor applied to the object in the x, y and z dimensions.
