Vessel
======

.. namespace:: krpc::services::SpaceCenter
.. class:: Vessel

   These objects are used to interact with vessels in KSP. This includes getting
   orbital and flight data, manipulating control inputs and managing resources.

   .. function:: std::string name()
   .. function:: void set_name(std::string value)

      The name of the vessel.

   .. function:: VesselType type()
   .. function:: void set_type(VesselType value)

      The type of the vessel.

   .. function:: VesselSituation situation()

      The situation the vessel is in.

   .. function:: double met()

      The mission elapsed time in seconds.

   .. function:: Flight flight(ReferenceFrame reference_frame = None)

      Returns a :class:`Flight` object that can be used to get flight
      telemetry for the vessel, in the specified reference frame.

      :Parameters:

       * **reference_frame** -- Reference frame. Defaults to the vessel's surface reference frame (:func:`Vessel::surface_reference_frame`).


      .. note:: When this is called with no arguments, the vessel's surface reference
                frame is used. This reference frame moves with the vessel, therefore
                velocities and speeds returned by the flight object will be zero. See
                the :ref:`reference frames tutorial <tutorial-reference-frames>` for
                examples of getting the :ref:`orbital speed
                <tutorial-reference-frames-orbital-speed>` and :ref:`surface speed
                <tutorial-reference-frames-surface-speed>` of a vessel.

   .. function:: Vessel target()
   .. function:: void set_target(Vessel value)

      The target vessel. ``NULL`` if there is no target. When
      setting the target, the target cannot be the current vessel.

   .. function:: Orbit orbit()

      The current orbit of the vessel.

   .. function:: Control control()

      Returns a :class:`Control` object that can be used to manipulate
      the vessel's control inputs. For example, its pitch/yaw/roll controls,
      RCS and thrust.

   .. function:: AutoPilot auto_pilot()

      An :class:`AutoPilot` object, that can be used to perform
      simple auto-piloting of the vessel.

   .. function:: Resources resources()

      A :class:`Resources` object, that can used to get information
      about resources stored in the vessel.

   .. function:: Resources resources_in_decouple_stage(int32 stage, bool cumulative = True)

      Returns a :class:`Resources` object, that can used to get
      information about resources stored in a given *stage*.

      :Parameters:

       * **stage** -- Get resources for parts that are decoupled in this stage.
       * **cumulative** -- When ``false``, returns the resources for parts decoupled in just the given stage. When ``true`` returns the resources decoupled in the given stage and all subsequent stages combined.


      .. note:: For details on stage numbering, see the
                discussion on :ref:`cpp-api-parts-staging`.

      every engine in the vessel.

   .. function:: float available_thrust()

      Gets the total available thrust that can be produced by the vessel's
      active engines, in Newtons. This is computed by summing

   .. function:: float max_thrust()

      engines when the vessel is in a vacuum, in Newtons. This is computed by
      summing :func:`Engine::max_vacuum_thrust` for every active engine.

   .. function:: float specific_impulse()

      The reference frame that is fixed relative to the vessel, and orientated with the vessel.

      * The origin is at the center of mass of the vessel.
      * The axes rotate with the vessel.
      * The x-axis points out to the right of the vessel.
      * The y-axis points in the forward direction of the vessel.
      * The z-axis points out of the bottom off the vessel.
