      See :enumerator:`AlarmType::maneuver`.

   .. enumerator:: apoapsis

      An alarm for furthest part of the orbit from the planet.

   .. enumerator:: periapsis

      An alarm for nearest part of the orbit from the planet.

   .. enumerator:: ascending_node

      Ascending node for the targeted object, or equatorial ascending node.

   .. enumerator:: descending_node

      Descending node for the targeted object, or equatorial descending node.

   .. enumerator:: closest

      An alarm based on the closest approach of this vessel to the targeted
      vessel, some number of orbits into the future.

   .. enumerator:: contract

      An alarm based on the expiry or deadline of contracts in career modes.

   .. enumerator:: soi_change

      An alarm manually based on when the next SOI point is on the flight path
      or set to continually monitor the active flight path and add alarms as it
      detects SOI changes.

   .. enumerator:: soi_change_auto

      See :enumerator:`AlarmType::soi_change`.

   .. enumerator:: transfer

      An alarm based on Interplanetary Transfer Phase Angles, i.e. when should
      I launch to planet X? Based on Kosmo Not's post and used in Olex's
      Calculator.

   .. enumerator:: transfer_modelled

      See :enumerator:`AlarmType::transfer`.
