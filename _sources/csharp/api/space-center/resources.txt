Resources
=========


.. class:: Resources

   Created by calling :prop:`Vessel.Resources`,
   :meth:`Vessel.ResourcesInDecoupleStage` or
   :prop:`Part.Resources`.

   .. property:: System.Collections.Generic.IList<Resource> All { get; }

      All the individual resources that can be stored.

   .. method:: System.Collections.Generic.IList<Resource> WithResource(string name)

      All the individual resources with the given name that can be stored.

      :parameters:

   .. property:: System.Collections.Generic.IList<string> Names { get; }

      A list of resource names that can be stored.

   .. method:: bool HasResource(string name)

      Check whether the named resource can be stored.

      :parameters:

       * **name** -- The name of the resource.

   .. method:: float Amount(string name)

      Returns the amount of a resource that is currently stored.

      :parameters:

       * **name** -- The name of the resource.

   .. method:: float Max(string name)

      Returns the amount of a resource that can be stored.

      :parameters:

       * **name** -- The name of the resource.

   .. method:: static float Density(string name)

      Returns the density of a resource, in kg/l.

      :parameters:

       * **name** -- The name of the resource.

   .. method:: static ResourceFlowMode FlowMode(string name)

      Returns the flow mode of a resource.

      :parameters:

       * **name** -- The name of the resource.



.. class:: Resource

   A resource stored within a part.

   .. property:: string Name { get; }

      The name of the resource.

   .. property:: Part Part { get; }

      The part containing the resource.

   .. property:: float Amount { get; }

      The amount of the resource that is currently stored in the part.

   .. property:: float Max { get; }

      The total amount of the resource that can be stored in the part.

   .. property:: float Density { get; }

      The density of the resource, in :math:`kg/l`.

   .. property:: ResourceFlowMode FlowMode { get; }

      The flow mode of the resource.

   .. property:: bool Enabled { get; set; }

      Whether use of this resource is enabled.



.. class:: ResourceTransfer

   Transfer resources between parts.

   .. method:: static ResourceTransfer Start(Part fromPart, Part toPart, string resource, float maxAmount)

      Start transferring a resource transfer between a pair of parts. The transfer will move at most
      *maxAmount* units of the resource, depending on how much of the resource is
      available in the source part and how much storage is available in the destination part.
      Use :prop:`ResourceTransfer.Complete` to check if the transfer is complete.
      Use :prop:`ResourceTransfer.Amount` to see how much of the resource has been transferred.

      :parameters:

       * **fromPart** -- The part to transfer to.
       * **toPart** -- The part to transfer from.
       * **resource** -- The name of the resource to transfer.
       * **maxAmount** -- The maximum amount of resource to transfer.

   .. property:: float Amount { get; }

      The amount of the resource that has been transferred.

   .. property:: bool Complete { get; }

      Whether the transfer has completed.



.. enum:: ResourceFlowMode

   See :meth:`Resources.FlowMode`.


   .. value:: Vessel

      The resource flows to any part in the vessel. For example, electric charge.


   .. value:: Stage

      The resource flows from parts in the first stage, followed by the second,
      and so on. For example, mono-propellant.


   .. value:: Adjacent

      The resource flows between adjacent parts within the vessel. For example,
      liquid fuel or oxidizer.


   .. value:: None

      The resource does not flow. For example, solid fuel.
