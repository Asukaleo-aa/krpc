      if time warp is not active. When in on-rails time warp, this is equal to
      :meth:`getRailsWarpFactor()`, and in physics time warp, this is equal to

      is active.

      If requested time warp factor cannot be set, it will be set to the next
      lowest possible value. For example, if the vessel is too close to a
      planet. See `the KSP wiki <https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Time_warp>`_ for details.

      :Game Scenes: Flight

   .. method:: int getPhysicsWarpFactor()

   .. method:: void setPhysicsWarpFactor(int value)

      The physical time warp rate. A value between 0 and 3 inclusive. 0 means
      no time warp. Returns 0 if regular "on-rails" time warp is active.

      :Game Scenes: Flight

   .. method:: boolean canRailsWarpAt(int factor)

      Returns ``true`` if regular "on-rails" time warp can be used, at the specified warp
      *factor*. The maximum time warp rate is limited by various things,
      including how close the active vessel is to a planet. See
      `the KSP wiki <https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Time_warp>`_
      for details.

      :param int factor: The warp factor to check.
      :Game Scenes: Flight

   .. method:: int getMaximumRailsWarpFactor()


      The current maximum regular "on-rails" warp factor that can be set.
      A value between 0 and 7 inclusive. See
      `the KSP wiki <https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Time_warp>`_
      for details.

      :Game Scenes: Flight

   .. method:: void warpTo(double ut, float maxRailsRate, float maxPhysicsRate)

      Uses time acceleration to warp forward to a time in the future, specified
      by universal time *ut*. This call blocks until the desired
      time is reached. Uses regular "on-rails" or physical time warp as appropriate.
      For example, physical time warp is used when the active vessel is traveling
      through an atmosphere. When using regular "on-rails" time warp, the warp
      rate is limited by *maxRailsRate*, and when using physical
      time warp, the warp rate is limited by *maxPhysicsRate*.

      :param double ut: The universal time to warp to, in seconds.
      :param float maxRailsRate: The maximum warp rate in regular "on-rails" time warp.
      :param float maxPhysicsRate: The maximum warp rate in physical time warp.
      :returns: When the time warp is complete.
