Vessel
======


.. type:: public class Vessel

   These objects are used to interact with vessels in KSP. This includes getting
   orbital and flight data, manipulating control inputs and managing resources.
   Created using :meth:`getActiveVessel()` or :meth:`getVessels()`.

      The type of the vessel.

   .. method:: VesselSituation getSituation()


      The situation the vessel is in.

   .. method:: boolean getRecoverable()


      Whether the vessel is recoverable.

   .. method:: Flight flight(ReferenceFrame referenceFrame)

      Returns a :type:`Flight` object that can be used to get flight
      telemetry for the vessel, in the specified reference frame.

      :param ReferenceFrame referenceFrame: Reference frame. Defaults to the vessel's surface reference frame (:meth:`Vessel.getSurfaceReferenceFrame()`).

      .. note:: When this is called with no arguments, the vessel's surface reference
                frame is used. This reference frame moves with the vessel, therefore
                velocities and speeds returned by the flight object will be zero. See
                the :rst:ref:`reference frames tutorial <tutorial-reference-frames>` for
                examples of getting the :rst:ref:`orbital speed
                <tutorial-reference-frames-orbital-speed>` and :rst:ref:`surface speed
                <tutorial-reference-frames-surface-speed>` of a vessel.
