===========


.. type:: public class SpaceCenter

   Provides functionality to interact with Kerbal Space Program. This includes controlling
   the active vessel, managing its resources, planning maneuver nodes and auto-piloting.

   .. method:: java.util.List<String> launchableVessels(String craftDirectory)

      Returns a list of vessels from the given *craftDirectory* that can be launched.

      :param String craftDirectory: Name of the directory in the current saves "Ships" directory. For example ``"VAB"`` or ``"SPH"``.

   .. method:: void launchVessel(String craftDirectory, String name, String launchSite)

      Launch a vessel.

      :param String craftDirectory: Name of the directory in the current saves "Ships" directory, that contains the craft file. For example ``"VAB"`` or ``"SPH"``.
      :param String name: Name of the vessel to launch. This is the name of the ".craft" file in the save directory, without the ".craft" file extension.
      :param String launchSite: Name of the launch site. For example ``"LaunchPad"`` or ``"Runway"``.

   .. method:: void launchVesselFromVAB(String name)

      Launch a new vessel from the VAB onto the launchpad.

      :param String name: Name of the vessel to launch.

      .. note::

         This is equivalent to calling :meth:`launchVessel(String, String, String)` with the craft directory set to "VAB" and the launch site set to "LaunchPad".

   .. method:: void launchVesselFromSPH(String name)

      Launch a new vessel from the SPH onto the runway.

      :param String name: Name of the vessel to launch.

      .. note::

         This is equivalent to calling :meth:`launchVessel(String, String, String)` with the craft directory set to "SPH" and the launch site set to "Runway".

   .. method:: void save(String name)

      Save the game with a given name.
      This will create a save file called ``name.sfs`` in the folder of the current save game.

      :param String name:

   .. method:: void load(String name)

      Load the game with the given name.
      This will create a load a save file called ``name.sfs`` from the folder of the current save game.

      :param String name:

   .. method:: void quicksave()

      .. note::

         This is the same as calling :meth:`load(String)` with the name "quicksave".

   .. method:: Camera getCamera()


      An object that can be used to control the camera.

   .. method:: double getUT()


      The current universal time in seconds.

   .. method:: double getG()


      The value of the `gravitational constant <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant>`_
      G in :math:`N(m/kg)^2`.

   .. method:: WarpMode getWarpMode()


      The current time warp mode. Returns :meth:`WarpMode.NONE` if time
      warp is not active, :meth:`WarpMode.RAILS` if regular "on-rails" time warp
      is active, or :meth:`WarpMode.PHYSICS` if physical time warp is active.

   .. method:: float getWarpRate()


      The current warp rate. This is the rate at which time is passing for
      either on-rails or physical time warp. For example, a value of 10 means
      time is passing 10x faster than normal. Returns 1 if time warp is not
      active.

   .. method:: float getWarpFactor()


      The current warp factor. This is the index of the rate at which time
      is passing for either regular "on-rails" or physical time warp. Returns 0
      if time warp is not active. When in on-rails time warp, this is equal to
      :meth:`getRailsWarpFactor()`, and in physics time warp, this is equal to
      :meth:`getPhysicsWarpFactor()`.

   .. method:: int getRailsWarpFactor()

   .. method:: void setRailsWarpFactor(int value)

      The time warp rate, using regular "on-rails" time warp. A value between
      0 and 7 inclusive. 0 means no time warp. Returns 0 if physical time warp
      is active.

      If requested time warp factor cannot be set, it will be set to the next
      lowest possible value. For example, if the vessel is too close to a
      planet. See `the KSP wiki <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Time_warp>`_ for details.

   .. method:: int getPhysicsWarpFactor()

   .. method:: void setPhysicsWarpFactor(int value)

      The physical time warp rate. A value between 0 and 3 inclusive. 0 means
      no time warp. Returns 0 if regular "on-rails" time warp is active.

   .. method:: boolean canRailsWarpAt(int factor)

      Returns ``true`` if regular "on-rails" time warp can be used, at the specified warp
      *factor*. The maximum time warp rate is limited by various things,
      including how close the active vessel is to a planet. See
      `the KSP wiki <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Time_warp>`_ for details.

      :param int factor: The warp factor to check.

   .. method:: int getMaximumRailsWarpFactor()


      The current maximum regular "on-rails" warp factor that can be set.
      A value between 0 and 7 inclusive.  See
      `the KSP wiki <http://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Time_warp>`_ for details.

   .. method:: void warpTo(double ut, float maxRailsRate, float maxPhysicsRate)

      Uses time acceleration to warp forward to a time in the future, specified
      by universal time *ut*. This call blocks until the desired
      time is reached. Uses regular "on-rails" or physical time warp as appropriate.
      For example, physical time warp is used when the active vessel is traveling
      through an atmosphere. When using regular "on-rails" time warp, the warp
      rate is limited by *maxRailsRate*, and when using physical
      time warp, the warp rate is limited by *maxPhysicsRate*.

      :param double ut: The universal time to warp to, in seconds.
      :param float maxRailsRate: The maximum warp rate in regular "on-rails" time warp.
      :param float maxPhysicsRate: The maximum warp rate in physical time warp.
      :returns: When the time warp is complete.
