Resources
=========


.. type:: public class Resources

   Represents the collection of resources stored in a vessel, stage or part.
   Created by calling :meth:`Vessel.getResources()`,
   :meth:`Vessel.resourcesInDecoupleStage(int, boolean)` or
   :meth:`Part.getResources()`.

   .. method:: java.util.List<Resource> getAll()


      All the individual resources that can be stored.

   .. method:: java.util.List<Resource> withResource(String name)

      All the individual resources with the given name that can be stored.

      :param String name:

   .. method:: java.util.List<String> getNames()


      A list of resource names that can be stored.

   .. method:: boolean hasResource(String name)

      Check whether the named resource can be stored.

      :param String name: The name of the resource.

   .. method:: float amount(String name)

      Returns the amount of a resource that is currently stored.

      :param String name: The name of the resource.

   .. method:: float max(String name)

      Returns the amount of a resource that can be stored.

      :param String name: The name of the resource.

   .. method:: static float density(Connection connection, String name)

      Returns the density of a resource, in kg/l.

      :param String name: The name of the resource.

   .. method:: static ResourceFlowMode flowMode(Connection connection, String name)

      Returns the flow mode of a resource.

      :param String name: The name of the resource.

   .. method:: boolean getEnabled()

   .. method:: void setEnabled(boolean value)

      Whether use of all the resources are enabled.


      .. note::

         This is true if all of the resources are enabled. If any of the resources are not enabled, this is false.



.. type:: public class Resource

   An individual resource stored within a part.
   Created using methods in the :type:`Resources` class.

   .. method:: String getName()


      The name of the resource.

   .. method:: Part getPart()


      The part containing the resource.

   .. method:: float getAmount()


      The amount of the resource that is currently stored in the part.

   .. method:: float getMax()


      The total amount of the resource that can be stored in the part.

   .. method:: float getDensity()


      The density of the resource, in :math:`kg/l`.

   .. method:: ResourceFlowMode getFlowMode()


      The flow mode of the resource.

   .. method:: boolean getEnabled()

   .. method:: void setEnabled(boolean value)

      Whether use of this resource is enabled.



.. type:: public class ResourceTransfer

   Transfer resources between parts.

   .. method:: static ResourceTransfer start(Connection connection, Part fromPart, Part toPart, String resource, float maxAmount)

      Start transferring a resource transfer between a pair of parts. The transfer will move at most
      *maxAmount* units of the resource, depending on how much of the resource is
      available in the source part and how much storage is available in the destination part.
      Use :meth:`ResourceTransfer.getComplete()` to check if the transfer is complete.
      Use :meth:`ResourceTransfer.getAmount()` to see how much of the resource has been transferred.

      :param Part fromPart: The part to transfer to.
      :param Part toPart: The part to transfer from.
      :param String resource: The name of the resource to transfer.
      :param float maxAmount: The maximum amount of resource to transfer.

   .. method:: float getAmount()


      The amount of the resource that has been transferred.

   .. method:: boolean getComplete()


      Whether the transfer has completed.



.. type:: public enum ResourceFlowMode

   The way in which a resource flows between parts. See :meth:`Resources.flowMode(String)`.


   .. field:: public ResourceFlowMode VESSEL

      The resource flows to any part in the vessel. For example, electric charge.


   .. field:: public ResourceFlowMode STAGE

      The resource flows from parts in the first stage, followed by the second,
      and so on. For example, mono-propellant.


   .. field:: public ResourceFlowMode ADJACENT

      The resource flows between adjacent parts within the vessel. For example,
      liquid fuel or oxidizer.


   .. field:: public ResourceFlowMode NONE

      The resource does not flow. For example, solid fuel.
